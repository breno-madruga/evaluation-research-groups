![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/breno-madruga/informetrics-research-groups)

## Description

This repository is responsible for versioning of the required source code to perform the proposed methodology of evaluation and cohesion analysis of research groups, which is in the process of being published in the JOI (Journal of Informetrics) journal.

</div>

## Input

The updated raw data could be collected by the Jupyter Notebook or Python Script, that are contained into the folder "data_collection".

The raw data are also available on [Data Mendeley](Data_Mendeley). Also, they are contained into the folder "data_analysis_pipeline/data/raw".

## Output

The final output is several plots, entities clustered by K-Means algorithm, and supplementary data that could support the process of temporal evaluation and cohesion analysis of research groups. In addition to the intermediate data, the final output is also generated by the use of DVC pipeline defined in this repository.

Some results generated by the proposed methodology are:
* Plots related to the temporal evaluation of research groups, by using the main metrics of Complex Network Analysis.
* Plots related to the temporal distribution of Connected Components' order, aiming to support the temporal analysis of cohesion in research groups.
* Plots of Time Series of number of Connected Components belonging to scientific teams, in order to support the temporal analysis of cohesion in research groups.
* Clustering of temporal networks belonging to the research groups, by using Graph Embedding Techniques.
* Temporal Clustering of members belonging to the research groups, by using Node Embedding Techniques.

## Steps for generating the results

For the execution of the following steps, I will consider that you already cloned/downloaded this repository, as well as the steps will be executed via shell/prompt within the folder of this repository. In addition, an essential prerequisite is that DVC is already installed on your machine.

For reusing the raw data that I already collected and the pipeline created, you can do the following steps:

1. Download the raw data, that is available on Data Mendeley, and put them in the ***data_analysis_pipeline/data/raw*** folder. You can download these files from this [link](link).

2. Execute the preprocessing pipeline. So, you can execute the following command:
    ```
    dvc repro
    ```
